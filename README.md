# Detection-of-mitosis-by-YOLO5-FUZZY
Detection of mitosis by YOLO5, FUZZY
This project is developed for one of the hospitals in Italy (unfortunately, due to the confidentiality of the project, I apologize for giving the information and only one of the normal projects of that center has been made public with the permission of the employer).
This project is about the detection of mitosis in the photos taken by the microscope, the points where mitosis has been done should be recognized and the fuzzy CLASS algorithm should be classified.
